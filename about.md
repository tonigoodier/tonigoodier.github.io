Hello, my name is Toni. I'm a History and Politics graduate with qualifications in Law. I'm interested in using my academic experence and political interests to persue a PhD. This blog will serve as a platform for me to share blog posts and other relevent things that I find interesting.

This site is very much a work in progress, so bare with me.
